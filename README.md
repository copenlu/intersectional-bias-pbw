Code and data for the ACL 2023 findings paper "Measuring Intersectional Biases in Historical Documents".

We're tidying the code and are hoping to put it up as soon as possible.

If you want access to the code beforehand, feel free to [reach out](mailto:nadav.borenstein@di.ku.dk) and we'll be happy to provide it before then.
